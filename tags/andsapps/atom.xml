    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had our first sprint demo on the 27/Aug, which didn't go without its hurdles. We showed the web app site, with initial
user registration, user management and experiments page.</p>

<p>and the experiments page</p>

<p><a href="/files/web-app-001.png"><img src="/files/web-app-001.png" width="350"></a></p>

<p>Then we discussed the virtual protein generator. We realised it should be called Protein Generator, as it is meant to generate two kinds
of protein DB files: one for predicted proteins, using gene scanner software as <a href="http://cbcb.umd.edu/software/glimmer/">glimmer</a>;
and <em>virtual proteins</em>, just generated by splitting the genome in contiguous blocks of certain size. We are aiming to have a first go
with this product this sprint.</p>

<p>The <em>samifier</em> was presented at the end. We had issues with the genome being split in several files, but at the end showed the
prototype, which was written in Ruby. We are aiming to produce a Java version by the end of this week to test it with researchers
in other kinds of datasets.</p>

<p>Researchers were happy with the demostration despite little issues, and are looking forward to the evolution of these initial
prototypes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ignatious just presented the project to the rest of the lab. One finds the slides <a href="/files/Proteomic-Genomic_Nexus.pptx">here</a>. The general feedback was positive,
bringing some ideas of what features we could have for IGV.</p>

<p>On the other hand, development just started on the <em>samifier</em> and the team is getting closer to a first cut. It is a prototype written in Ruby.
It won't have reverse strand handling, but will be able to generate fragments of forward encoded proteins, even if they are split by introns.</p>
