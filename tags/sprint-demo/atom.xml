    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had our first sprint demo on the 27/Aug, which didn't go without its hurdles. We showed the web app site, with initial
user registration, user management and experiments page.</p>

<p>and the experiments page</p>

<p>Then we discussed the virtual protein generator. We realised it should be called Protein Generator, as it is meant to generate two kinds
of protein DB files: one for predicted proteins, using gene scanner software as <a href="http://cbcb.umd.edu/software/glimmer/">glimmer</a>;
and <em>virtual proteins</em>, just generated by splitting the genome in contiguous blocks of certain size. We are aiming to have a first go
with this product this sprint.</p>

<p>The <em>samifier</em> was presented at the end. We had issues with the genome being split in several files, but at the end showed the
prototype, which was written in Ruby. We are aiming to produce a Java version by the end of this week to test it with researchers
in other kinds of datasets.</p>

<p>Researchers were happy with the demostration despite little issues, and are looking forward to the evolution of these initial
prototypes.</p>
