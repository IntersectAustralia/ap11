Marc Wilkins presented a poster titled "Validation of Genomes and Transcriptomes with Proteomics Data" at the 18th meeting of the Australian Proteomics Society at Lorne. Marc reported that the poster was of exceptional interest. He said that over the two hour session, there was a constant stream of people keen for an explanation. Groups were from local facilities (including APAF) along with some from overseas. 

This is a great success for the project and we look forward to hearing more as people start trying out the software.
