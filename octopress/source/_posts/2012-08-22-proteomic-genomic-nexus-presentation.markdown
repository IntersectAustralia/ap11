Ignatious just presented the project to the rest of the lab. One finds the slides [here](/files/Proteomic-Genomic_Nexus.pptx). The general feedback was positive,
bringing some ideas of what features we could have for IGV.

On the other hand, development just started on the _samifier_ and the team is getting closer to a first cut. It is a prototype written in Ruby.
It won't have reverse strand handling, but will be able to generate fragments of forward encoded proteins, even if they are split by introns.
