The Sofware Requirements Specification (SRS) is live as a set of pages answering some general questions about the project. 

Here they are:

1. Who is doing this? [Product team](/product-team/)
1. Why is it worth doing? [Main goals](/why/)
1. Who is this for? [Users](/users/)
1. What is the added value? [Specific goals](/measuring-success/)
1. How is it going to work? [Features and architecture](/design/)
1. What will be the outcomes? [Products and outcomes](/outcomes/)

We will be updating these entries as we go and are a key reference in the evolution of the project.
