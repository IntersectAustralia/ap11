This software project is a joint effort by the *Ramaciotti Centre* at UNSW, as domain experts, and *Intersect*,
which brings software development expertise. Although we acknowledge the contribution of many people, we can only
provide details of the main collaborators in this project.

*People from the Centre working for this project:*

#### Prof. Marc Wilkins

Leader of the project and director of the Centre. Marc has published &gt;100 peer-reviewed research papers,
review papers and book chapters and has edited 2 books.  Marc's research has tackled many of the key issues
in proteomics. A particular strength has been the capacity to combine large-scale analytical techniques with
complex bioinformatics to open new avenues for biological investigation. Current research interests are (i)
the role of protein methylation in the proteome (ii) the dynamics of protein interaction networks and (iii)
the analysis of next-generation sequencing data.

#### Dr Chi Nam Ignatius Pang

Ignatius Pang studied Bachelor of Bioinformatics Engineering at the University of New South Wales. Dr. Pang 
completed PhD in 2010 on the topic "The Dynamics of Protein Interaction Networks", under the supervision of Prof. 
Marc Wilkins at UNSW. In his thesis, he explored different mechanisms that govern interactome dynamics.
He is one of key contacts are the Centre for the project.
