A successful solution would

 * allow the Centre to manipulate the protein search process to use transcriptome data
 * allow the Centre to transform the protein search results into a format suitable for visualisation along genomic data
 * allow the Centre to transform peptide intensity data into a format suitable for visualisation along genomic data
 * allow the Centre to publish data so other researchers can perform similar comparisons
 * will reuse as much as possible existing software tools
 * and reuse as much as possible existing IT knowledge from researchers, so they can adjust and maintain these tools in the future

## Ensuring quality

_Intersect_ follows software development best-practices based on an Agile process with regular meetings with stakeholders to ensure
the end product delivers the most added value to them as per project objectives.

It also has a dedicated internal QA team, independent of developers, who serve as first filter between what is produced by the developers
and what gets delivered to end users.
