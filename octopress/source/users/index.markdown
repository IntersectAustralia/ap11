This product will be for researchers working in proteomics and its relationship to genomics, i.e. those interested in understanding
the relationship between the genetic code and the transcriptome.

It requires familiarity with the set of command line tools available in this area, and aims to complement the toolbox by
developing few command line utilities that bridge gaps in the pipeline as preliminary work by researchers in the Ramaciotti
Centre has demonstrated.

Among the tools our end user must be familiar with are:

1. [TopHat](http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/)
1. Gene scanner software
1. [Mascot](http://www.matrixscience.com/products.html): Search algorithm for Mass Spectral proteomics datasets
1. [cufflinks](http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/)

Our key stakeholders are researchers from the [Ramaciotti Centre](ramaciotti.unsw.edu.au) at [UNSW](http://www.unsw.edu.au/).
